# Model providers

Articraft supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and OpenRouter. OpenAI is the default.

## Configure a provider

Set the API key for the provider that you want to use:

| Provider | API key | Default model | Reference images |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `gpt-6-astra` | Yes |
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `claude-sonnet-5` | Yes |
| Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `gemini-3.6-flash` | Yes |
| OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free` | Opt-in |

You can put the key in `.env` or set it for one command. Do not commit API keys.

Select a provider with `--provider`:

```shell
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here uv run articraft \
  --provider anthropic "a folding chair"
```

## Select a model

OpenAI defaults to GPT-6 Astra with `high` reasoning effort. GPT-5.6 Sol remains
available with `--model gpt-5.6-sol` or `ARTICRAFT_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol`.
The `gpt-5.6` alias also selects Sol.

```shell
uv run articraft --model gpt-5.6-sol "a folding chair"
```

Both models use the Responses API over WebSockets. Articraft keeps a 272,000-token
working context budget and a 128,000-token output limit. Astra supports `low`,
`medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` reasoning effort. It does not support `none`.
See OpenAI's [Astra model documentation](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-6-astra)
and [migration guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model).

Cost estimates use OpenAI's [standard token prices](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing),
including cached input and cache writes. Sol's current promotional pricing is
available at least through November 21, 2026.

Use `--model` to replace the default model:

```shell
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here uv run articraft \
  --provider gemini --model gemini-3.6-flash "a folding chair"
```

Articraft passes an unknown model name to the selected provider. The provider returns an
error if it does not accept the name.

The live interface cannot estimate cost or context use for an unknown model. The run can
still continue if the provider accepts the model.

## Use OpenRouter

OpenRouter accepts text prompts only by default. Do not pass `--image` with this provider
unless the selected model takes images and you set `ARTICRAFT_OPENROUTER_IMAGES=1`.

Set `OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER` and `OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE` if you want OpenRouter attribution.
These values are optional.

OpenRouter reports token use and request cost when its API returns them. Articraft does not
keep a context window catalog for OpenRouter models.

Set `ARTICRAFT_OPENROUTER_CONTEXT_WINDOW_TOKENS` to the selected model's context window to
enable conversation compaction — the number is on the model's OpenRouter page, or in
`GET /api/v1/models` as `context_length`. Articraft replaces older turns with a compact
summary when the conversation approaches that budget, and the live interface shows context
use against it. When the value is unset, Articraft does not know the window and never
compacts. Values between 1 and 36383 are rejected.

The model's maximum output size is separate from its context window. If it is below
8192, set `ARTICRAFT_OPENROUTER_SUMMARY_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` to that limit or lower.
This setting defaults to 8192 and must be positive. It caps summary requests only.
A smaller limit requested by the agent is still respected. It does not change ordinary
generation requests.

## Point the OpenRouter provider at a local server

The OpenRouter provider speaks plain OpenAI `/chat/completions`, so it drives any
OpenAI-compatible server — vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama — with no new provider code. Set the
base URL to the server's `/v1` root:

```shell
ARTICRAFT_PROVIDER=openrouter \
ARTICRAFT_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001/v1 \
ARTICRAFT_OPENROUTER_MODEL=qwen \
ARTICRAFT_OPENROUTER_CONTEXT_WINDOW_TOKENS=262144 \
uv run articraft "a chest of drawers"
```

`ARTICRAFT_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` accepts the `/v1` root or the full
`/v1/chat/completions` path. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is required only when the base URL is
openrouter.ai itself; a self-hosted server needs no credential, and no `Authorization`
header is sent when the key is unset. Set the key anyway if your server checks one.

Reasoning models served by vLLM with `--reasoning-parser` return their thinking in
`message.reasoning`, which this provider records as `provider_content` and replays on the
next request, so a reasoning-only turn is not lost.

### Images from a local vision model

`ARTICRAFT_OPENROUTER_IMAGES=1` turns on image input for endpoints whose model accepts it —
it enables `view_image`, the image-aware prompts, and `--image`. Articraft's `input_image`
items are sent as chat-completions `image_url` parts carrying the base64 data URL. A
chat-completions `tool` message cannot carry an image, so an image returned by `view_image`
is sent in a user message immediately after the tool result.

Leave the setting off for openrouter.ai and for any text-only model: with it off, an image
in the conversation raises an error rather than being silently dropped.

## Use the Python API

Pass the same provider and model names to `generate()` or `generate_async()`:

```python
result = articraft.generate(
    "a folding chair",
    provider="anthropic",
    model="claude-sonnet-5",
)
```

The function checks the required API key before it starts the run.
